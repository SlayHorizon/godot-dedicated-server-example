# Godot Dedicated Server Example 
*(Compatible with Godot 4.x - 4.4)*

This repository contains straightforward, minimal and functional examples of a dedicated server
and client built with Godot, organized into two separate projects.
<br/><br/>

## Getting Started ðŸš€
To get started with these examples, simply clone the repository and open each project in Godot.
<br/><br/>

## Documentation ðŸ“š
For further information, the official Godot documentation is an excellent resource:
- **[Networking](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/index.html)**
- **[High-Level Multiplayer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html)**
<br/><br/>

## Single Project Solution ðŸŒŸ
In addition to the basic examples, I made a more advanced project that combines  
both client and server functionality into a single Godot project.  
This project also showcases additional features for a more comprehensive networking experience with Godot.
