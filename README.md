# Godot Dedicated Server Example  
*Compatible with Godot 4.x – 4.4*

This repository provides minimal, functional examples of a dedicated server and a client using Godot’s high-level multiplayer API.  
The two parts are organized as separate Godot projects for clarity and modularity.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `client` and `server` projects separately in Godot.
3. Run the server, then connect the client to test the communication.
